1. Put original data files in data file fold
2. 'lab_part1.Rmd' is basically the file used in the first lab of chapter 3&4, with a little code copied from the book. Use this for reference.
3. How to collaborate with Github?
 
    Whenever you want to record the code change locally on computer, save the RMD file, select changes and click 'commit to main' on GitHub Desk. This can help you track significant changes you've made, so you can find the bug when your codes suddenly run uexcepted error. 
    
    When you finish a part of work and want to merge with others' code, select changes, click 'commit to main' on GitHub Desk and click 'push origin' on GitHub Desk (There should be no need to pull a request again). And then I will merge codes.
    
    When you want to have latest version RMD after we merged, click the refresh sybom on GitHub Desk (the same place of 'push origin'), click 'pull from origin', and then it will ask you whether you wanna overwrite your file. So plz make sure you have pulled and merged your previous change to cloud before you overwrite!!
