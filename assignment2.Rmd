# Data Wrangling

## Data Loading and Cleaning

**loading data and transforming in to 'ESRI:102254'**

**(glimpsing with mapview / simply plot)**

**removing error data and trimming data into county limits**
two ways to trim, select from "county" column, or use geometry

**(selecting a specific subset)**
sometimes need sometimes not, decisions will be made depending on group summary

## Feature Engineering

**sum within census track** 
(least optional for most situation)

**sum within fixed buffer**
(assuming scale relationship uniform countywide)

**average distance of k-nearest case**
combine school name with sale data

### School
```{r}

sale <- sale %>% 
  st_join(school.elementary)
# rename column
sale <- rename(sale, c( "elmtr_school" = "Name","elmtr_school_points" = "Total_Percent_Points"))

combine school distance with sale data
```{r combine school distance with sale data}
